# Spherique
Image simulator using determined physics ball collisions

Created as a fun side project to explore real-time physics, numerical stabilitY and system design â€” blending math, art, and code; Spherique is a fun experimental project exploring basic physics simulation in Python using Verlet integration and Pygame.

It models hundreds of interacting spheres under gravity, complete with collisions, boundary constraints and optional color mapping from an image.

This project was inspired by Joe Liang after I saw an Instagram post on his version of this. I rewrote and extended the core logic to include better performance, configuration management, headless operation and deterministic simulation control.
